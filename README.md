## GPT-Zoom-Integration  

This project involves creating a Node.js bot that integrates with Zoom meetings. The bot will be capable of understanding and responding to participants' verbal input using GPT. It achieves this by converting the voice input from Zoom into text, processing the text using GPT, converting the text response back into spoken word, and relaying the response through Zoom. The ultimate objective is to enable seamless verbal communication with GPT through the Zoom platform.
